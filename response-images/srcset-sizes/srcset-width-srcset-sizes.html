<p class="example-description">
	When using the <code>sizes</code> attributes you are able to specify what size of the image that should be used
	in CSS pixels by defining matching media conditions. The intention is you as the author know exactly how an image
	will be used, and if you know for example that at certain viewports the image will only be 300px wide, or
	<code>33vw</code>, you define this. The browser will then be able to pick smaller images in some cases saving size.
</p>

<h2 id="match-order">Match order</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	The statements in <code>sizes</code> are read first to last, and the first matching one will one. This means order
	is important depending on how you write your media conditions.
</p>
<h3 id="fallback">Fallback</h3>
<p class="example-description">
	The final entry in <code>sizes</code> doesn't have a condition, it's just a source size value. It is a fallback
	and is used if none of the media conditions match.
</p>

<h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	If no image in <code>srcset</code> has a width descriptor that exactly matches an image then generally the
	browser will round up to the next largest. This essentially errs on ensuring the image always looks good vs.
	choosing the smallest image.
</p>

<h2 id="dpr">CSS pixels, device pixels and pixel density</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	Note the following about different parts of <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In <code>sizes</code> the media condition and the source size descriptor of each entry are both in CSS pixels.
	</li>
	<li>
		In <code>srcset</code> the width descriptor is in device pixels.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="example-description">
	When going from the <code>sizes</code> source size descriptor to find the matching <code>srcset</code>
	width descriptor a conversion happens between CSS pixels and device pixels. This conversion takes the pixel
	density/device pixel ratio into account. See the worked example below for more details.
</p>

<h2 id="art-direction">Art direction?</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	It might seem like you could use the media conditions in <code>sizes</code> to control art direction. For example
	you might specify that on devices that were less than 300px you use a square image, but on devices that are larger
	than this you'll use a rectangular image. This won't work for two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Pixel density corrections by the browser</b>. As described in the <a href="#dpr">pixel density</a> section
		above,
		the browser will choose different images if there is a higher pixel density, even if the screen size in CSS
		pixels is identical. For example if you had the example image at the top of the page, and you were on a 300px
		device. On a 1x DPI device the browser might select the 300px image, but on a 2x device it might select the
		600px image. If you'd made your 600px image a rectangle, this wouldn't be correct on mobile.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b><code>srcset</code> values are only suggestions</b>. The browser can decide to download a different image than
		the one that might have matched exactly, for example it might download a smaller image if network conditions
		are poor.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="example-description">
	If you want art direction, the solution is to use the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element.
</p>

<h2 id="img-el-width">Image element width</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	When <code>srcset</code> is used with <code>sizes</code> the width of the image element on the page is
	set according to the source size descriptor of the matching <code>sizes entry</code>. E.g. if the
	entry <code>(min-width: 600px) 600px</code> matches, the image will be 600 CSS pixels wide. Note this will
	apply regardless of the actual size of the source image, as the browser essentially trusts you've given it
	correct information in the <code>sizes</code> attribute, so won't override that even if the actual image has a
	different size, it essentially replaces the intrinsic dimensions of the image.
</p>

<h2 id="srcset-sizes-worked-example">Worked example</h2>
<p class="example-description">
	Above is an example image using <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code>. Described here are the steps taken
	by the browser to work out the final image to display, in this example for an iPhone 11 in portrait orientation.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Work out the entry from <code>sizes</code> that matches:
		<ol>
			<li>The width of an iPhone 11 in CSS pixels is 414.</li>
			<li>Going down the <code>sizes</code> list from the top, the first condition to match is
				<code class="sizes-media-condition">min-width: 300px</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				This has a source size value (the right-hand size) of
				<code class="sizes-source-size-value">300px</code> which is the desired width
				of the image in CSS pixels.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Work out that entry from <code>srcset</code> that matches:
		<ol>
			<li>
				First work out what the desired image size in device pixels. We do this by multiplying the source
				size value we just worked out by the device's pixel density, which for iPhone 11 is 2. In this case
				that's:
				<i style="display: block; margin-left: var(--spacing-20)">
					<span class="sizes-source-size-value">300px</span> (CSS pixels) * 2 (pixel density) =
					600px (device pixels)
				</i>
			</li>
			<li>
				The <code>srcset</code> attribute is then consulted to find the closest matching image. In this case
				there is a width descriptor of <code class="srcset-width-descriptor">600w</code> which matches 600px
				exactly. This results in the corresponding <code class="srcset-src">600x600.png</code> image being
				chosen.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
