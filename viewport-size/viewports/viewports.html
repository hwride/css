<!--
Show initial containing block using outline. Can't use background as this applies to entire page not just the
html element. Notice how the ICB never moves from the document origin, even when we scroll.

Show the layout viewport using a <code>position: fixed</code> element. This is always fixed to the layout
viewport. Notice how the layout viewport is always fixed to the viewport, so is visible regardless of scroll.

Notice how the layout viewport and ICB are always the same size, just sometimes in different positions.
